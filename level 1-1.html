        <p>
            It was the time before<br>
            I was born.<br>
            I was thin.<br>
            I was hungry. I was<br>
            only a restlessness inside a womanâ€™s body.
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Above us, lightning split open the sky.<br>
            Below us, wagon wheels cut land in two.<br>
            Around us were the soldiers,<br>
            young and afraid,<br>
            who did not trust us<br>
            with scissors or knives<br>
            but with needles.<br>
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Tear dresses they were called<br>
            because settler cotton was torn<br>
            in straight lines<br>
            like the roads we had to follow<br>
            to Oklahoma.<br>
    
        </p>
    
        <p>
            But when the cloth was torn,<br>
            it was like tears,<br>
            impossible to hold back,<br>
            and so they were called<br>
            by this other name,<br>
            for our weeping.<br>
        </p>
    
        <p>
            I remember the women.<br>
            Tonight they walk<br>
            out from the shadows<br>
            with black dogs,<br>
            children, the dark heavy horses,<br>
            and worn-out men.<br>
        </p>
    
        <p>
            They walk inside me. This blood<br>
            is a map of the road between us.<br>
            I am why they survived.<br>
            The world behind them did not close.<br>
            The world before them is still open.<br>
            All around me are my ancestors,<br>
            my unborn children.<br>
            I am the tear between them<br>
            and both sides live.<br>
        </p>
