                <strong>It</strong>was the time before<br>
                I was born.<br>
                I was thin.<br>
                I was hungry. I was<br>
                only a restlessness inside a woman’s body.

                <em><em1>Above us,</em1> 
                    lightning split open the sky.<br>
                Below us, wagon wheels cut land in two.<br>
                Around us were the soldiers,<br>
                young and afraid,<br>
                who did not trust us<br>
                with scissors or knives<br>
                but with needles.<br>

            <em2>Tear</em2> dresses they were called<br>
            because settler cotton was torn<br>
            in straight lines<br>
            like the roads we had to follow<br>
            to Oklahoma.<br>

            <em3>But</em3> when the cloth was torn,<br>
            it was like tears,<br>
            impossible to hold back,<br>
            and so they were called<br>
            by this other name,<br>
            for our weeping.<br>

                <em4>I</em4> remember the women.<br>
                Tonight they walk<br>
                out from the shadows<br>
                with black dogs,<br>
                children, the dark heavy horses,<br>
                and worn-out men.<br>

                They walk inside me. This blood<br>
                is a map of the road between us.<br>
                I am why they survived.<br>
                The world behind them did not close.<br>
                The world before them is still open.<br>
                All around me are my ancestors,<br>
                my unborn children.<br>
                I am the tear between them<br>
                <em5>
                    and both sides live.<br>
