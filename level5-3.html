            <span class="It">It</span> was the time before<br>
            I was born.<br>
            I was thin.<br>
            I was hungry. I was<br>
            only a restlessness inside a womanâ€™s body.

            Above us, lightning split open the sky.<br>
            Below us, wagon wheels cut land in two.<br>
            Around us were the soldiers,<br>
            young and afraid,<br>
            who did not trust us<br>
            with scissors or knives<br>
            but with needles.<br>

        Tear dresses they were called<br>
        because settler cotton was torn<br>
        in straight lines<br>
        like the roads we had to follow<br>
        to Oklahoma.<br>

   <div class="body4">
    <p>
        But when the cloth was torn,<br>
        it was like tears,<br>
        impossible to hold back,<br>
        and so they were called<br>
        by this other name,<br>
        for our weeping.<br>

    <div class="body5">

            I remember the women.<br>
            Tonight they walk<br>
            out from the shadows<br>
            with black dogs,<br>
            children, the dark heavy horses,<br>
            and worn-out men.<br>
        </p>

            They walk inside me. This blood<br>
            is a map of the road between us.<br>
            I am why they survived.<br>
            The world behind them did not close.<br>
            The world before them is still open.<br>
            All around me are my ancestors,<br>
            my unborn children.<br>
            I am the tear between them<br>
            and both sides live.<br>
