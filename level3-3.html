                <big><strong>It</strong> was the time before<br>
                I was born.<br>
                I was thin.<br>
                I was hungry. I was<br>
                only a restlessness inside a woman’s body.

                <big><strong>Above us,</strong> lightning split open the sky.<br>
                Below us, wagon wheels cut land in two.<br>
                Around us were the soldiers,<br>
                young and afraid,<br>
                who did not trust us<br>
                with scissors or knives<br>
                but with needles.<br> </big>

            <strong>Tear</strong> dresses they were called<br>
            because settler cotton was torn<br>
            in straight lines<br>
            like the roads we had to follow<br>
            to Oklahoma.<br></big>

                <strong>But</strong> when the cloth was torn,<br>
                it was like tears,<br>
                impossible to hold back,<br>
                and so they were called<br>
                by this other name,<br>
                for our weeping.<br></big>

                <strong>I</strong> remember the women.<br>
                Tonight they walk<br>
                out from the shadows<br>
                with black dogs,<br>
                children, the dark heavy horses,<br>
                and worn-out men.<br></big>

            <p><big>
                <strong>They</strong> walk inside me. This blood<br>
                is a map of the road between us.<br>
                I am why they survived.<br>
                The world behind them did not close.<br>
                The world before them is still open.<br>
                All around me are my ancestors,<br>
                my unborn children.<br>
                I am the tear between them<br>
                and both sides live.<br></big>
